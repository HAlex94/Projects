# GPT-3 Streamlit Application

This project harnesses the power of OpenAI's GPT-3 model to provide a user-friendly interface for text summarization and Q&A chatbot functionalities. Built with Streamlit, it offers an intuitive web-based platform for users to interact with GPT-3 without diving deep into the technicalities.

## Features:
- **Document Summarization**: Upload a text document or paste content directly into the application. With a click, get a concise summary generated by GPT-3.
- **Q&A Chatbot**: After uploading a document, you can ask questions related to the content. The application will provide answers based on the document's context.
- **CSV Interpretation**: Upload a CSV file, and the application will generate a human-readable summary, making it easier to understand complex datasets.
- **Token Count**: To ensure efficient usage of the GPT-3 API, the application provides a real-time token count, helping users stay within the model's token limit.

## How It Works:
- **Streamlit Interface**: The application uses Streamlit, a fast and easy way to turn data scripts into shareable web apps.
- **GPT-3 Integration**: Leveraging OpenAI's GPT-3.5-turbo, the application processes user inputs and returns generated summaries or answers.
- **Token Management**: Utilizes the `tiktoken` Python library from OpenAI to count tokens in a text string without making an API call.
- **Dynamic Content Truncation**: To ensure the content stays within GPT-3's token limit, the application intelligently truncates content while preserving its essence.
